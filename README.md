# SJ-Check-Outs-Analysis

This notebook works with combined data from the Saint James hostel's current monthly booking sheet and archive sheets to analyse check-outs data from the beginning of the year until present (August 2023). It presents a dashboard style overview of key check-outs metrics.

Key takeaways include:

1) a price peak in May despite a bookings peak in June/July  
2) a higher number of check-ins on Fridays and Saturdays  
3) a high turnover of single guest bookings for only 1 night  
4) near dominance by Booking.com as a booking provider
